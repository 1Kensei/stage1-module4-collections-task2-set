You need to implement the following tasks:
1. Write a method to iterate through all elements in a HashSet containing the days of the week (strings). The method should return a string containing the elements of the set, separated by a space.
2. Write a method to clone a HashSet to another HashSet. The method should return a string containing the elements of the set, separated by a space.
3. Write a method to compare two sets and retain elements that are the same on both sets.First HashSet should contain "Red", "Green","Black", "White" elements, second HashSet should contain "Red", "Pink", "Black", "Orange" elements.  The method should return a string containing the elements of the first set, separated by a space.
4. Write a method to create a new TreeSet, add all the days of the week (string). The method should return a string containing the elements of the set, separated by a space.
5. Write a method to find the numbers less than 10 in a new TreeSet. The method should return a string containing the elements of the set, separated by a space.
